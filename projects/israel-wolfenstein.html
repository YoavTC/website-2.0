    <h2>The Idea:</h2>
    <p>
        When I started working on this game, it was (and still is as of 26/06/23) a time of uncertainty in Israel. There was a big movement to change how laws are passed and regulations are approved, a move that would give more power to the government and less to the Supreme Court.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am not going to sit here and pretend that I know how this stuff works, but the gist of it is that it will turn Israel from a democratic country to a less democratic country.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of people are comparing the situation to how Nazi Germany rose to power in the early 1920s. Although I think this example is a bit extreme, it can happen, and it has happened in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
        The comparison reminded me of the old game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D" target="_blank">Wolfenstein 3D</a>. A game
        where you play as an American hero that goes into Hitler's castle of evil to defeat Nazi Germany once and for all. <br> Cartoonish sillyness aside,
        I like the game very much, and consider it, like many others, the foundation of first person shooters.

    <h2>Technical Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This game was made in the Unity game engine, I made all of the art myself, apart from a 3D model that my mother's friend Atar Brosh kindly gave me the rights to use. The music was taken from a few websites (legally, of course), and credits can be found in the pictures section down below.
