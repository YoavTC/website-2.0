        I wanted to try and make a flute mod in Minecraft for a long time before actual development started. I don‚Äôt remember why or when, but I knew I wanted to add another level of peacefulness to my Minecraft base.
    </p>
    <p>
        I live in a Meadow, which is one of the most calming and peaceful biomes in Minecraft due to its blue water, not so saturated green grass, and its tendency to generate near tall mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
        So one day, I was having my morning cup of tea (which I also want to add to the game) while sitting playing Minecraft on my PC. I was observing the view from my base, and thought to myself that the perfect addition to this vibe would be flute sounds. Something out of a kung-fu-panda movie, or Avatar the Last Airbender's outro theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quickly after I started coding the item into the game, I ran into the issue of not knowing how to control the notes on the flute. Most instruments are too complicated to be directly implemented into video games, so game developers find ways around the lack of fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best example that I could find is the way Guitar Hero's strings turned into buttons on a custom controller or keyboard keys, with each button representing a string, and the timing of the keys being pressed is what determined the score.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seeing that there were no famous games with controllable implementations of flutes, I decided to try to make something new.
    </p>
    <p>
        I took the player's pitch (the angle of where they look up and down), and put it into a function that plays the correct note based on said pitch. I also decided not to modify one sound with many pitches, because it sounded awful, and instead recorded multiple sounds with my mother's flute.
    </p>
    <p>
        After finishing up some final touches, I published the mod on <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bamboo-flute" target="_blank">CurseForge</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mod was also featured on TheDerpyWhale's <a href="https://youtu.be/3-sAjXnRzR4?t=180" target="_blank">Youtube Video</a>.
