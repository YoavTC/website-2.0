        I got the idea for 'Pizza Defender' after I smacked a big mosquito with a fly swatter, and then I thought, Hey, this could make a fun game! So I started working.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is a 'wave-shooter' kind of game, but instead of shooting enemies, you squash bugs with your swatter. The more bugs you kill, the more points you get. Each bug rewards the player with a certain amount of points, as well as making the game a bit harder by increasing the multiplier of each bug's movement speed and decreasing the time between each bug spawn, making the game harder as you go on.

        It was my first Mobile game so I had to learn a bit on how Unity handles touch input, but got I got it pretty fast with the help of some YouTube tutorials. I initially wanted the game to be on iOS and Android, but after some research, I found out that I need to have a MacBook in order to ship games to the App Store, so I went with the Play Store.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the sounds, textures, and design were made by me; it was a really nice experience making non-pixel art textures for a change, and the recording of sounds is always fun.
