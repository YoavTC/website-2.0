        I started this project when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war" target="_blank">2023 Israel-Hamas war broke</a> out. As I lived in Israel and are still living here at the type of writing this (20/11/2023), I found it very tough like many to just continue what they were doing before the war started. So I started this as a side project.

        Snowboard Tapper is a simple mobile game where the player needs to just survive as long as possible without hitting the trees or walls 3 times.
        <br> My mom wanted to help me make a game so I let her make the tree assets.
